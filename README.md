# Salifort Motors Employee Turnover Prediction & Analysis

# Business Scenario
Salifort Motors is facing a significant challenge with a high employee turnover rate, which includes both voluntary resignations and involuntary terminations. This issue is not only disruptive to the company’s operations but also financially costly due to the substantial investments in recruiting, training, and upskilling employees. The senior leadership team is committed to fostering a supportive corporate culture that encourages employee success and professional development. To address the turnover issue, they aim to predict which employees are at risk of leaving and understand the underlying reasons behind their decisions.

# Business Task
The leadership team has tasked me with:

Analyzing the Key Factors: Identify the main drivers of employee turnover by analyzing various data points, including job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and other relevant factors.

Building a Predictive Model: Develop a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company. This model will serve as a tool to help the company improve employee retention and job satisfaction.

Providing Insights and Recommendations: Share actionable insights and recommendations with the leadership team to help them implement strategies that will increase retention, enhance job satisfaction, and reduce the financial burden of turnover.

# Approach to the Solution

# Data Collection & Preparation

Data Gathering: I began by collecting comprehensive data from HR surveys and employee records. This included key factors such as job title, department, tenure, number of projects handled, average monthly hours worked, and employee satisfaction levels.

Data Cleaning: To ensure accuracy and reliability, I meticulously addressed any inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers in the dataset.

Feature Engineering: I enhanced the model's predictive power by creating new features, such as tenure in the current role, average monthly hours per project, and employee satisfaction scores.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive Statistics: I analyzed key turnover metrics, such as turnover rates by department, job title, and tenure, to understand the broader context.

Correlation Analysis: Through correlation analysis, I identified significant relationships between turnover and factors like workload, job satisfaction, and employee engagement.

Visualization: I utilized visual tools—bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps—to uncover patterns and trends in the data, making insights more accessible.

# Model Development

Model Selection: I carefully selected machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to accurately predict employee turnover.

Training & Validation: I split the data into training and validation sets, allowing me to train the model effectively and evaluate its performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: By optimizing model parameters, I improved accuracy and reduced the risk of overfitting.

# Model Evaluation

Performance Metrics: I evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure it effectively predicts turnover.

Feature Importance: I analyzed which features were most influential in predicting turnover, providing clear insights into the main drivers behind employee departures.

# Recommendations

Retention Strategies: Based on the model's findings, I recommended strategies to enhance employee retention, including workload management, career development opportunities, and targeted interventions for at-risk employees.

Continuous Monitoring: I suggested implementing ongoing monitoring of employee sentiment and turnover risk, enabling proactive issue resolution before they lead to departures.

# Presentation to Leadership

Summary of Findings: I presented a concise summary of the analysis, highlighting key insights and the factors most strongly associated with turnover.

Actionable Recommendations: My recommendations to the leadership team were clear and actionable, focusing on improving retention and job satisfaction.

Visualizations: I used data visualizations to effectively communicate the findings and the model’s predictions, ensuring the message was clear and impactful.

# Expected Outcomes

By implementing the predictive model and recommendations, Salifort Motors can expect:

Improved Retention Rates: Identifying at-risk employees and addressing their concerns will reduce turnover and help retain top talent.

Cost Savings: Lower turnover will lead to significant cost savings related to recruiting, training, and upskilling new employees.

Enhanced Job Satisfaction: Fostering a supportive work environment will result in higher employee engagement, satisfaction, and productivity.
