# Salifort Motors Employee Turnover Prediction & Analysis
# Business Scenario
Salifort Motors is facing a significant challenge with a high employee turnover rate, which includes both voluntary resignations and involuntary terminations. This issue is not only disruptive to the company’s operations but also financially costly due to the substantial investments in recruiting, training, and upskilling employees. The senior leadership team is committed to fostering a supportive corporate culture that encourages employee success and professional development. To address the turnover issue, they aim to predict which employees are at risk of leaving and understand the underlying reasons behind their decisions.

# Business Task
The leadership team has tasked me with:

Analyzing the Key Factors: Identify the main drivers of employee turnover by analyzing various data points, including job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and other relevant factors.

Building a Predictive Model: Develop a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company. This model will serve as a tool to help the company improve employee retention and job satisfaction.

Providing Insights and Recommendations: Share actionable insights and recommendations with the leadership team to help them implement strategies that will increase retention, enhance job satisfaction, and reduce the financial burden of turnover.

# Approach to the Solution

# Data Collection & Preparation

Data Gathering: Collect data from the HR survey and employee records, including factors such as job title, department, tenure, number of projects handled, average monthly hours worked, and employee satisfaction levels.
Data Cleaning: Address any inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers in the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Feature Engineering: Create new features, such as tenure in the current role, average monthly hours per project, and employee satisfaction scores, to enhance the model’s predictive power.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Analyze key metrics related to turnover, such as turnover rates by department, job title, and tenure.
Correlation Analysis: Identify correlations between turnover and factors such as workload, job satisfaction, and employee engagement.
Visualization: Use visual tools like bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps to uncover patterns and trends in the data.

# Model Development:

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict employee turnover.
Training & Validation: Split the data into training and validation sets to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model parameters to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Model Evaluation:

Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure it effectively predicts turnover.
Feature Importance: Analyze which features are the most influential in predicting turnover, providing insights into the main drivers behind employee departures.

# Recommendations:

Retention Strategies: Based on the model’s findings, recommend strategies to enhance employee retention, such as workload management, career development opportunities, and targeted interventions for at-risk employees.
Continuous Monitoring: Suggest implementing ongoing monitoring of employee sentiment and turnover risk to proactively address issues before they lead to departures.
# Presentation to Leadership:

Summary of Findings: Present a concise summary of the analysis, highlighting key insights and the factors most strongly associated with turnover.
Actionable Recommendations: Provide clear, actionable recommendations to the leadership team for improving retention and job satisfaction.
Visualizations: Use data visualizations to effectively communicate the findings and the model’s predictions.

# Expected Outcomes
By implementing the proposed predictive model and recommendations, Salifort Motors can expect:

Improved Retention Rates: By identifying at-risk employees and addressing their concerns, the company can reduce turnover and retain top talent.
Cost Savings: Lower turnover will result in reduced costs related to recruiting, training, and upskilling new employees.
Enhanced Job Satisfaction: Fostering a supportive work environment will lead to higher employee engagement, satisfaction, and productivity.
